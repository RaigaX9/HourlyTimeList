# HourlyTimeList

##Introduction
Create an hourly time list from 9AM to 5PM where users can reserve their appointment. The user can click
on any time slots where a modal will popup in which it will require them to input their name and phone number.
After clicking on 'Save', the information will be stored and the button will turn to red. Another option is the
user can go back to that same slot, which is still red, and shows their information prepopulated in the text
box and can edit their information.
